# Implementing Design Patterns in Dart

In this project, I aim to implement design patterns in the Dart programming language in a very simple and straightforward way. Naturally, this project does not include any specific architecture, structure, or UI and focuses entirely on logic code. For a detailed study of design patterns, I highly recommend visiting the website [Refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), which provides some of the best and most comprehensive articles on this topic.

Note that simply implementing these design patterns is not sufficient; the key lies in understanding how and why to use them. The critical aspect is choosing the right pattern based on the project's requirements and understanding when to apply each one.

As you may know, these design patterns were created by four computer scientists —**Erich Gamma**, **Richard Helm**, **Ralph Johnson**, and **John Vlissides**— who are famously known in the software development community as the "**Gang of Four**."

In the first phase, I plan to implement 10 commonly used design patterns, with the remaining patterns being gradually added over time. These 10 patterns include:

1. [Singleton]()
2. [Factory Method]()
3. [Observer]()
4. [Strategy]()
5. [Decorator]()
6. [Adapter]()
7. [Command]()
8. [Composite]()
9. [Chain of Responsibility]()
10. [State]()

These patterns are categorized into three main packages: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral**. I will gradually expand this project by adding the remaining patterns over time.

I hope this project proves useful to you.
